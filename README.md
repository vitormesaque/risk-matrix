# Risk Matrix Generation from App Reviews using Large Language Models

This repository contains code and resources for generating a Risk Matrix from App Reviews using Large Language Models. The proposed approach utilizes the OPT model (Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models) for feature extraction and risk impact evaluation.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to automatically analyze app reviews and categorize the severity or impact of risks mentioned in them. By organizing the risks into a Risk Matrix, we aim to provide a standardized risk assessment process for software product maintenance and evolution.

## Key Features

- Dynamic and automatic prompt generation: Customized instructions are created for each review, allowing the OPT model to accurately extract app features mentioned by users.
- Risk impact classification: Instructions are developed to automatically identify the severity or impact of risks mentioned in the reviews, categorizing them into five levels: negligible, minor, moderate, major, and critical.

## Results

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in extracting features with limited labeled data and automatically categorizing the severity or impact of risks. The Risk Matrix generated provides valuable insights for software maintenance and evolution.
